# MEARN Blog

This is a blog application implemented using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. There are also seperate readme files for the frontend and backend.

## Backend Setup

cd backend
npm install mongodb
npm install dotenv

```

## Security Considerations

Include the file `config.env` in your `.gitignore` file.
